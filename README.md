# Software Strobing using black frame insertion to reduce motion blur
Software black frame insertion to reduce display motion blur at expense of hz displayed and flickering on any display type.

Causes more flickering than crt (because the entire screen/area is revealed at once instead of just a line), more uneasy on the eyes than crt, but it does reduce blur at the expense of framerate shown and slight discomfort...

Demo of black frame insertion at Blur Busters (works on any hz monitor including 60hz standard) https://www.testufo.com/blackframes
